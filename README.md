# SolarGuard: AI Defect Detection for Solar Panels

This project uses deep learning to classify solar panel images into six categories.

Model used is **`MobileNetV2`** classifier trained using feature extraction.

###  Model Performance 
It achieves a **77.0% reproducible accuracy** 
  * **Overall Accuracy:** 77.0%
  * **Physical-Damage Recall:** **85%**
  * **Electrical-damage Recall:** **80%**

### 🗂️ Classification Classes

The model classifies panels into one of six categories:

1.  Bird-drop
2.  Clean
3.  Dusty
4.  Electrical-damage
5.  Physical-Damage
6.  Snow-Covered


This project is for educational purposes as part of the GUVI Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program.
